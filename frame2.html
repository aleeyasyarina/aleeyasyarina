      <li><b>Story:</b> This was the first event organized by our classmates outside of UiTM, held at Pusat Kebajikan Anak Yatim Islam Segamat for IMD317 tasks. My classmates and I were very pleased with how the program turned out and had a great time with the PKAYIS residents while playing the games provided. The highlight for me was when my team managed to secure 2nd place. Through this program, we also had the opportunity to strengthen our bond as classmates, even though we werenâ€™t initially very close. Overall, everything went smoothly and successfully.
